\begin{dedication}
To my parents, who gave me life and strength; \\
to my beloved who brings stillness in my torrential storm; \\
and to those who have endured --- \\
the fallen, the widowed, the forgotten, \\
whose stories deserve to be remembered and retold. \\
May this work stand as a small act of remembrance. \\
\end{dedication}
