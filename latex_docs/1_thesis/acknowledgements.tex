\begin{acknowledgements}
To my parents, who gave me life and strength;

to my beloved, who brings stillness in my torrential storm;

and to those who have endured---the fallen, the widowed, the forgotten---whose stories deserve to be remembered and retold.  

May this work stand as a small act of remembrance---an offering to those who came before us, and a reminder for those who follow.
