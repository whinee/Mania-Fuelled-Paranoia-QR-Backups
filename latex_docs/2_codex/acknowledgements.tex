\begin{acknowledgementslong}
I would like to thank my parents, who gave me life and strength.

Thank you to my beloved, who brings stillness in my torrential storm.

Thank you to those who have endured—the fallen, the widowed, the forgotten---whose stories deserve to be remembered and retold.  
May this work stand as a small act of remembrance—an offering to those who came before us, and a reminder for those who follow.

Thank you to my doctors for treating me and trusting that I was "fit for school." 
You have shown me that healing doesn't always look stable, and that chaos can still create something beautiful.

And finally, to those living with Bipolar Disorder—who have ever thought, "I can't do this anymore," 
who have dropped out, started again, collapsed, and kept breathing anyway:  
you are seen, you are needed, you are not alone.  

Thank you for being alive.
We survive, together.
